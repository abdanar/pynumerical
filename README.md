# PyNumerical

## Introduction
My goal is to include a comprehensive range of numerical integration and differentiation methods in this module, named `pynumerical`.

## Numerical methods
Below is a list of the numerical methods that will be added to the library, along with those that are currently available in `pynumerical`.

### Currently available methods
- Trapezoidal rule
  
### Future Additions
- Midpoint rule
- Simpson's method
- Simpson's 3/8 rule
- Romberg's method
- Boole's rule
